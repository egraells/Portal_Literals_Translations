You are receiving a list of 100 <trans-unit> XML elements. 
Each <trans-unit> instance will contain the following elements:
- id: A unique identifier for the <trans-unit>.
- maxwidth: maximum character width for the translation.
- size-unit: the unit of the maxwidth attribute.
- source: the original text to be translated.
- target: an example of a translated value into another language.

Your task is to provide the same list of <trans-units> but in the <target> node you must provide the translation of the text in the <source> node into Russian.
For example, for the following <trans-unit> element:
<trans-unit id="CustomLabel.Text" maxwidth="240">
<source>Advanced Editor</source>
<target>Erweiterter Editor</target>
</trans-unit>

The expected answer from you is:
<trans-unit id="CustomLabel.Text" maxwidth="240">
<source>Advanced Editor</source>
<target></target> <-- THIS TARGET NODE SHOULD CONTAIN THE TRANSLATION TO Russian of the <source> node.
</trans-unit>

So, the only change expected in every <trans-unit> is the <target> node, with will contain translation of the source text into Russian.

Follow these guidelines:
- Do not add any header and neither number the lines.
- Do not miss any <trans-unit> element.
- Do not change the id, maxwidth, or size-unit attributes.
- Use professional healthcare terminology for translation as appropriate for healthcare professionals.
- The translation should not exceed the maxwidth characters.
- For HTML-like content, translate only the visible text, leaving any markup intact.
- If the text includes double quotes, leave them unchanged.
- Words in CAPITAL LETTERS should remain in capital letters in the translation.
- Translate all <trans-unit> elements without omitting any.

Also, when translating consider the following particularities:

This is the list of sequence of <trans-unit> sequence:

<trans-unit id="CustomLabel.PSP_ArchiveSearch_Phone" maxwidth="1000" size-unit="char"> <source>Phone</source> <target>None</target></trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="CustomLabel.PSP_Back" maxwidth="1000" size-unit="char"> <source>Back</source> <target>None</target></trans-unit>
